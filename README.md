# unit-four-homework

This is a quiz webpage which currently has a coding-related quiz but could be used as a base for a quiz about anything.  It consists of two html pages, a css styling page, a javascript page for the main functionality and a javascript page for the questions.

The focus on this activity was to use javascript functionality to replace elements on a page as the user interacts with it.  This includes a timer that begins when the user starts the quiz, a fifteen second penalty for questions answered incorrectly, and a final score that is tabulated based on time remaining when the quiz is completed.

It would be very easy to replace the current questions by simply editing the questions array or adding a separate questions page with other questions.

This activity also makes use of local storage to create a leaderboard with the user's previous scores.
